#summary Writing and using plugins for JsDoc Toolkit

= Introduction =

New in Version 2 of JsDoc Toolkit is the ability to add your own functionality into the core processing of your source code (before it is ever sent to your template). This can be a convenient and portable way to change the way JsDoc Toolkit works to suit your own needs.

== It's Easy ==

The interface was designed to be simple. If you are using a plugin, installing it is as easy as saving the plugin file to the app/plugins directory - that's it. The plugin will automatically be loaded and used for you.

== For Example ==

Writing a plugin is also simple. The first step is to create a new text file; you can name it whatever you like. The contents of that plugin file should follow this pattern:

{{{
    JSDOC.PluginManager.registerPlugin(
    "JSDOC.myPluginName",
    {
        onSymbol: function(symbol) {
            // modify properties of the symbol here
        }
    }
);
}}}

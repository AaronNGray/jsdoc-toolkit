#summary @memberOf

== The @memberOf Tag ==

The `@memberOf` tag allows you to document what you consider the "parent" or container of an object to be.

=== Syntax ===

{{{
@memberOf parentNamepath
}}}

  * parentNamepath - Required: the namepath of the containing object.

=== Example ===

{{{
var Tools = {};

/** @namespace */
var Tools.Dom = {};

/** @memberOf Tools.Dom */
var hiliteSearchTerm = function(term) {
}

Tools.Dom.highlightSearchTerm = hiliteSearchTerm;
}}}

Without the `@memberOf` tag, the `hiliteSearchTerm` function would be documented as a global function. That's because, in fact, it is a global function, but it is also a member of the `Tools.Dom` namespace as well, and that's how you wish to document it.

=== In Addition ===

There are two tags that act as if they are combined with `@memberOf`:

  * @methodOf - is a shorter synonym for `@function` plus `@memberOf`
  * @fieldOf - is a shorter synonym for `@field` plus `@memberOf`

=== See Also ===

  * the [TagName @name] tag.
